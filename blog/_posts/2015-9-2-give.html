Last night over a card game my friend revealed how he decides on whether or not he'll buy a new game. "Gameplay and reviews. Otherwise you just don't know." 
 </p>



<h2>Satisfying Basic Needs</h2>
<p>
Visitors come to PlayStation.com to learn about an entertainment platform and software it supports, and if we're lucky, make the purchase. Unfortunately we are competing in a space with some pretty huge players and some deeply embedded user behaviors but if we can understand what our user's needs are AND how they are fulfilled we can point their established cow paths back to PDC.
</p>
<p>
    In the sample group that was tested (and my small group of gamer friends) we found that no one will purchase a game on a trailer alone. No one reads much either (at least no one is willing to spend the time reading content that doesn't fulfill their need state). Users skim until something catches their eye or they find what we are looking for (not mutually exclusive events). Instead of distracting users with content they don't find helpful why can't we make the whole exchange dead simple and give them what they want right off the bat? 
</p>
<h2>Establishing a Baseline</h2>
<p>
    Users are looking for reviews and gameplay, something we do a pretty poor job of delivering. Ultimately it only hurts us; they'll find it somewhere else and more than likely will not come back. Why? Because user experiences are a double edged blade. We remember the good and the bad, the pleasure and the pain. If you asked someone for help only to be ignored would you ask them again next time?

Providing a functional and reliable foundation for our site's user experience is the foundation upon which the pyramid of design needs will be built.

<p>
    Satisfying the baseline user need is only the first step in our quest to build a solid user experience but I would contend that it's the most important area of focus. Much like any other development or design focused project great things need to be supported by a solid foundation.
