“That’s been one of my mantras – focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” 
</br>- Steve Jobs

<h2>Focus is Important</h2>
<p>
It's easy to get overwhelmed by stakeholder requirements, new features, updates, and product launches when maintaining a website as big as <a href="playstation.com">PlayStation.com</a> but it's important to remember what the point of it all is. If there is no north star to steer the ship how can we expect to be anything other than stranded at sea?</p>

<p>Think of all the successful mobile applications that have become astronimically successful in the last few years and you will find that a focused and simple user experience is a common underlying foundation.</p>

<p> This style of thinking isn't only used for singularly focused mobile applications, thinking about how you would explain  common web services we use everyday to your an unfrozen caveman.</p>

<p> While these products and services are now all huge networks comprised of millions of pages, features, users and data points they all became successful because they focused on one thing and did it well. Product-centric thinking, understanding what the core purpose of the sum of all our efforts is, not only clears the fog of war obstructing our path to building something great but also upholds the integrity of the product itself. There's no sense in adding new features that don't support the core pillar, it only serves to complicate, confuse and veer us farther from our destination.<p>

<p>So what is our <strong>one thing</strong>? Is it to sell consoles? Games? Subscriptions? Is it to fulfill stakeholder requirements? Maybe it's to engage with our users in a way no one else can? Whatever it may be once the focus (the mission) for playstation.com is defined and understood the way forward will reveal itself.
